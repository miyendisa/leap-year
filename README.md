## Details

### What is a leap year?
A normal year has 365 days. A Leap Year has 366 days. So, the extra
day is the 29th of February.

## How to calculate leap years ?
* A leap year is exactly divisible by 4 except for century years.
  * 1988 - 1992 - 1996 - 2000 - 2004
* If it can be exactly divided by 100 (century years), then it 
isn't a leap year.
  * 1700 - 2100 - 2200
* The century year is a leap year only if it is perfectly divisible 
by 400.
  * 1200 - 1600 - 2000
